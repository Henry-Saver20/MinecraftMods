Minecraft mods for a private server. **All content is property of their respective owners CC 2020**

Hi guys! Heres a quick little tutorial to help you get everything set up!

**Step 1.**
Head over to technic and use this link in your launcher to download the pack
 http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/yaopack
 
**Step 2.**
Once you have installed the pack youre going to want to head to the mods folder inside of the pack.
This can be done through the technic launcher by clicking on the settings.

**Step 3.**
Install the folder on this github page with the mods in it.

**Step 4.**
Drag all of the mods inside of that folder into the mods folder inside of your technic pack.

If the pack asks you to update when you go to launch always remember to say *NO* as it will delete
the extra mods.

And thats all! Hope you guys enjoy :)
